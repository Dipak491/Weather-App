I wanted to spend some time learning jQuery and HTML5 Canvas. This is basically my first app made using html canvas, so there's a lot of room for improvements.

**Feel free to use this code, but please create your own API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) so that it doesn't get blocked due to overuse. Thank you.**
